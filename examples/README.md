Real-world examples of skill outputs demonstrating best practices and expected results.

## Task Decomposer Examples

### Authentication System Decomposition
**File**: `task-decomposer/example-auth-decomposition.md`

Complete example showing how to decompose "Implement user authentication system" into:
- 8 actionable subtasks (2-4 hours each)
- Rationale for decomposition approach
- As-is → to-be state analysis
- Risk assessment matrix
- Dependency graph
- Timeline estimates

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Multiple phases with dependencies
- Parallel work opportunities
- Testing criteria per subtask
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Critical path identification

## Issue Manager Examples

### Blocker Report
**File**: `issue-manager/example-blocker-report.md`

Comprehensive blocker report for a payment processing feature blocked by external approval:
- Blocker context and impact
- Timeline and escalation history
- Unblocking strategies
- Stakeholder notifications
- Action items by team
- Resolution criteria

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Multi-day blocker tracking
- Impact analysis (revenue, team velocity)
- Escalation procedures
- Contingency planning
- Stakeholder communication

## Using These Examples

### As Learning Material

Study these examples to understand:
- Proper format and structure
- Level of detail expected
- How to identify dependencies
- Risk assessment approaches
- Communication best practices

### As Templates

Use as starting points for your own:
- Task decompositions
- Blocker reports
- Issue analysis

### As Validation

Compare your outputs against these examples:
- Is your decomposition as detailed?
- Did you identify similar risks?
- Are your action items specific?
- Is the format clear and scannable?

## Example Scenarios
